Succubus 6 (Devil In The Deep Blue Sea): A LitRPG Series by A.J. Markam Book Review

Name: Amazon Customer
Rating: 1.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Sadly the series evidences a hatred of one religion
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019
Review: Having read the first 5 books in this series and enjoyed them, it is sad that the author decided to go to war with Christianity in this one. It is fine to argue with prudes who don‚Äôt like the sex in the series, but to explicitly attack a religious group was unnecessary and frankly embarrassing. If the author had attacked another religion in the same vein that he denigrates Christians he would likely have been pilloried. It is unfortunate that the series has fallen to this level. If I could have offered zero stars I would have - and asked for a refund as well. The hatred here is palpable.

Title: Mixing sex and religion rarely bodes well
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019
Review: I began reading this series when it first dropped and have: loved, laughed and even gotten a little misty eyed. I thoroughly enjoyed the hijynx that an imp, a succubus, and a human can get up to. I especially enjoy that Ian's feelings on monogamy are NOT invalidated. That's usually a knee-jerk go-to for this genre and it cheapens the characters. In fact, I love how ALL the characters are validated.

This one threw me for a loop, though. I love this series and thought the author felt the same for his fans, but today... I felt alienated.

Some things need to be addressed. First, A HORRIBLE (and INCORRECT) caricature of Christianity is represented in this book and I honestly have no idea why. I couldn't figure out if the author was trying to drive the story forward or vent some past slight. Either way, it just came across as insulting and weird.

These "deuteragonist" could have been filled by any lemmings. Why a base, amalgamation of an actual ideology was warranted; is something Jack and Jose will have to tell me on Friday.

I have to point out Christianity is about rebuilding a relationship with God, not "good behavior." Ian made a remark about "good religions" fostering good behavior and it's something atheists often incorrectly say. Ian was trying to be conciliatory to true Christians, but his (false) bravado (ignorance) caused him to miss the mark.

Ie: Define good? Ian thought he was being good calling out the hecklers . The hecklers thought they were being good. Meanwhile, everyone is heckling each other and no one is closer to the truth.

Seriously, the story was fine without all this. I feel like 6000 years of culture and customs was reduced to the least common denominator for a cheap thrill.

Judging from a purely story narrative, it's 4 stars. Even without the religious debacle.

The others had more drama. More flare. This feels like a filler episode. I have to take that star off because the villains would have had more gravitas if the author spent more time on the lemmings (or not at all).

Title: AJ Markam does it again!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019
Review: How much can one POSSIBLY write about a Nerdkin QC dweeb and his exploits inside the hottest game around? Quite a lot, actually, when it‚Äôs coming from the mind of this author. I was pretty impressed at the end of volume one, but thought that was probably the best he could do, and installment one would also double as installment last. Oh, how very wrong I was. Every installment since then has been SO entertaining; filled with plot twists, great character development, and, well, yes - some pretty amazing...woohoo? ( not sure how the Amazon censors will react to that 3-letter word, so woohoo it is).

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - the plot lines in Succubus don‚Äôt simply serve as the conveyer belt to another mindless woohoo session. Far from it; Mr. Markam has a particular gift for leading you, quite easily, I might add, in one direction, only to suddenly yank you into a place that you never saw coming. He‚Äôs done it over and over, and the net result is six books, all about the same ‚Äúsometimes cool, sometimes loathsome‚Äù QC dude Ian and his crew, where every episode leaves you thoroughly entertained and thoroughly satisfied. And you can‚Äôt wait for the next one.

War and Peace this series isn‚Äôt. But say what you will about the content; this author has a real talent for putting ideas together in a manner that is most pleasing. I truly enjoy his work, and look forward to the next Succubus installment, and his next projects after he brings Succubus to an end. Sure - jump into Succubus for the woohoo, but stick around for some top-shelf storytelling. You‚Äôll be SO glad you did!
